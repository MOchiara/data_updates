title: CDOM  drift
content: An ongoing issue affects CDOM in glider with the FLBBCD sensor deployed from 2022-09-01. In the affected datasets, CDOM values show a temporal decrease. From 2022-12-01, the protective copper plate covering the sensor was removed on all the gliders deployed in Bornholm and Gotland. This resolved the temporal decrease, but some sensors displayed a temporal increase. Investigation is ongoing and data quality remains uncertain. All affected datasets have been flagged. Check the variable cdom_qc.

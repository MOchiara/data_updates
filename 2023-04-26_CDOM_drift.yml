title: CDOM  drift
content: There is an apparent issue in the CDOM values affecting gliders with the FLBBCD sensor deployed from 2022-09-01. In the affected datasets, CDOM values show a temporal decrease. From 2022-12-01, the protective copper plate covering the sensor was removed on all the gliders deployed in Bornholm and Gotland. This resulted in no temporal drift in most gliders but some showed a temporal increase instead. Investigation is ongoing and data quality remains uncertain. All affected datasets have been flagged. Check the variable cdom_qc.

title: CODA oxygen sensors deterioration of foils
content: The RBR CODA oxygen sensors have shown a temporal drift and fail to detect low oxygen concentration. Some of the bottom waters where the gliders operate are known to be de-oxygenated. Water samples taken from periodic research vessel CTD casts show 0-5 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, as do other oxyegn sensors used on gliders in the same area at the same time. However, none of the CODA sensors  are able to detect the 0 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> oxygen concentration and show a minimum value of 15-20 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> in waters that should be de-oxygenated. All affected datasets have been flagged with the variable <textit>oxygen_concentration_qc</textit>. We are working to fix the affected sensors.

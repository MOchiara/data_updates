title: AROD oxygen sensors poisoning of foil
content: There is an apparent issue in the dissolved oxygen concentration values affecting all gliders with the AROD RINKO dissolved oxygen sensor deployed from 2022-12-01. In the affected datasets, oxygen concentration is around 100 umol m^{-3} less than expected. This offset decreased during the mission at a non linear rate. The cause of the issue is currently beleived to be outgassing from the 3D printed protective caps that are put over the sensor foil to protect it during transport and storage. All affected datasets have been flagged. Check the variable oxygen_concentration_qc.

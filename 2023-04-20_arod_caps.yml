title: AROD oxygen sensors deterioration of foils
content: A fault has affected dissolved oxygen concentration values on all gliders with the AROD RINKO dissolved oxygen sensor deployed from 2022-12-01. In the affected datasets, oxygen concentration is around 100 Î¼mol m<sup>-3</sup> less than expected. This offset decreased during the mission at a non linear rate. All affected datasets have been flagged with the variable <textit>oxygen_concentration_qc</textit>. We are working to fix the affected sensors.
